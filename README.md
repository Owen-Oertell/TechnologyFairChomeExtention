Tools Used
HTML, JavaScript, and CSS were used to make the base structure of the Chrome Extension. HTML and CSS were used to make a pleasing Graphical User Interface that is used within the popup.
The jQuery library was used to add functionality to the “Delete” button for our Chrome extension.
Chrome developer tools were used to make the application non-intrusive and pleasing. These tools were also used to be able to use our Recipe Chrome extension easily on any computer with Google Chrome.
